            <p>This camp is very enjoyable for children because it is fun, exciting, and educational at the same time. </p>
          <p>On the first day of camp, students will perfect their art skills, while also learning to draw some very fun things, such as cars and dragons.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p> The second day of camp is equally fun, and is taught by the same teacher from day one, who happens to be a skilled player of the violin. </p>
          <p>
            In the music class, kids will learn to control the volume, pitch, and sound of their voices.
          </p>
          <p>The third day of camp is very exciting, requires a child with lots of energy, and is super fun!</p>
          <p>This camp is probably the most useful, with children learning to speak in front of an audience. Whether they are practicing to give a huge speech,</p>
          <p>or trying to overcome stage fright, these kids will soon be amazing public speakers!</p>
          <p>And all of this completely free! Three consecutive days of happiness, all for the price of fun!</p>
